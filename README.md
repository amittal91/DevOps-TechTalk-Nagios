# DevOps - TECH TALK - Nagios

###What is Nagios?

Nagios is a **monitoring tool** which monitors your entire IT infrastructure to ensure systems, applications, services, and business processes are functioning properly. In the event of a failure, Nagios can alert technical staff of the problem, allowing them to begin remediation processes before outages affect business processes, end-users, or customers. **Nagios Core** serves as the basic event scheduler, event processor, and alert manager for elements that are monitored. It features several APIs that are used to extend its capabilities to perform additional tasks, is implemented as a daemon written in C for performance reasons, & is designed to run natively on Linux/*nix systems.
