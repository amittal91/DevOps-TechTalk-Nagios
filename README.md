# DevOps - TECH TALK - Nagios Core

###What is Nagios Core?

Nagios is a **monitoring tool** which monitors your entire IT infrastructure to ensure systems, applications, services, and business processes are functioning properly. In the event of a failure, Nagios can alert technical staff of the problem, allowing them to begin remediation processes before outages affect business processes, end-users, or customers.
